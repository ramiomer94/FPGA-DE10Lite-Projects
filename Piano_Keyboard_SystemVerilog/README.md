# FPGA Music Box - Piano Keyboard Project

This project implements a simple FPGA-based piano keyboard on the DE10-Lite board using SystemVerilog. It plays musical tones based on key switches and generates a square wave output to drive a speaker or buzzer.

---

## Features

- Supports 8 piano keys via on-board switches (`SW[7:0]`)
- Generates corresponding audio frequencies using PWM or clock dividers
- Output connected to GPIO pin for speaker
